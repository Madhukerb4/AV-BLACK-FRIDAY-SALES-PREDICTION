# AV-BLACK-FRIDAY-SALES-PREDICTION
Analytics Vidhya Black Friday Sales Prediction Hackathon

As part of the model build, created 4 sections.

1. Explanatory Data Analysis of all the features
2. Data Engineering - creation of new features 
3. Feature Selection Methods

   a. Filters Methods - Constant, Quasi-Constant, Correlation and ANOVA combination features selection 
   
   b. Wrapper Methods - Step Backward Feature Selection with Linear Regression Algorithm
   
   c. Embedded methods 
   
       1. Regularization - Lasso with feature selection - Selectfrommodel
       2. Tree Based Feature Importance methods - Random Forest Regressor and ExtraTrees Regressor
4. Models

   a. Parameters Hyper Tuning
   
   b. Models
      1. Linear Regression
      2. XGBoost Regressor
      3. CatBoost Regressor
      
   c. Model Evaluation
      1. Explained Variance Score
      2. Mean Absolute Error
      3. Mean Squared Error
      4. Root Mean Squared Error
      5. Scatter Plot between Actual and Predicted values
      6. Residual Scatter Plot
      7. Residual Distribution plot
      8. Q-Q plots for residuals
      9. Residual Normality Statistical Test (Shapiro)
      10. Residual Homoscedasticity of variance Statistical Test (Bartlett or Levene)
